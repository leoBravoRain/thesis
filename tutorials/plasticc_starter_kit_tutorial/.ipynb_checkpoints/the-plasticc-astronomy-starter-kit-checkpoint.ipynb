    "(Historical parenthetical: The original Julian Date which began counting up from zero on noon on Jan 1, 4713 BC. When the Soviet Sputnik launched, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory decided to make this zero reference date a little more current. The SAO needed a way to keep track of Sputnik's orbits but the reference for the Julian date was so far in the past that the numbers were too large for their VAX/VMS system to handle. So they did the simple thing and made the reference date of the VAX/VMS system the same as the reference date for their new time system - creatively named the \"Modified Julian date\" - and consequently, most of astronomy. This date is conveniently 2400000.5 - the extra 0.5 because the VAX reference starts at midnight, while the Julian Date starts from noon.)"

Be warned though that the actual photometric redshift distribution is asymmetric, and the redshift is not likely to be less than zero, so you might want to treat it as just a weight.
